Basics
SQL, often pronounced "see-quell", stands for Structured Query Langauge and is the language used to query relational databases. Although you may have never actually worked with a relational database, you are probably already very familiar with their structure and concepts, likely through working with spreadsheet programs like Excel. To review, here are some of the basic ideas.
Data are organized into tables, like spreadsheets using the Excel analogy.
Tables consist of named columns and zero or more rows
Columns contain a data type (integer, float, string, etc...)
Rows may be indexed by a primary key which is a column, or a set of columns, used to uniquely identify each row.



Import some data
Before getting into writing queries, we first need to load some data. We're going to use the mtcars dataset that is often used in R and Python examples. If you need a copy of the .csv, it can be downloaded here, and it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with the data a bit before proceeding. Also, be sure that all columns have a name. Once you have the data, put it in the same directory as this notebook. Now open up a command prompt in your OS, navigate to the directory containing the data, and run the command sqlite3. You should now see a sqlite3> indicating that the server is running and ready for commands. Now enter the following into the sqlite3 console.

      .mode csv
      .import mtcars.csv mtcars
